## Purpose
To create a daily planner that will use local storage to save events, show current tiime, and use colors to show what evebts are past present and future. 

## Description '

I made a daily planner that displays the time and date. It has tiime blocks labeled for a workday. I still need to use color-coding to indicate whether it is in the past, present, and future. I also need to make the save buttons function.
